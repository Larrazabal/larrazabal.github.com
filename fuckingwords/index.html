				<p>All I ask from you is this:</p>
				<p>Now, lets discuss something very important</p>
				<p>It's a mess.</p>
				<p>This is no joke.</p>
				<p>Just wait 'till you try this</p>
				<p>Heck...</p>
				<p>And yet it's only the beginning</p>
				<p>And besides that,</p>
				<p>There's more. A lot more.</p>
				<p>I'll tell you this:</p>
				<p>Here's what it means:</p>
				<p>Reason why is simple:</p>
				<p>What's the bottom line?</p>
				<p>Take, as an example,</p>
				<p>This is amazing enough, but even more remarkable is the fact that...</p>
				<p>Why does that work? Because:</p>
				<p>So what happend?</p>
				<p>Now, for the kicker that may surprise you:</p>
				<p>Listen:</p>
				<p>Sure,</p>
				<p>For example,</p>
				<p>What's more...</p>
				<p>That means...</p>
				<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
				<p>And check this out:</p>
				<p>One more thing, it's important.</p>
				<p>And that's just for starters.</p>
				<p>Hang on. We're not through yet.</p>
				<p>It gets even better.</p>
				<p>Do you understand what this means?</p>
				<p>You think I'm lying, don't you?</p>
				<p>Who else uses this secret?</p>
				<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
				<p>How would you like to see it for yourself?</p>
				<p>Sound good to you?</p>
				<p>The truth is this:</p>
				<p>So what's next?</p>
				<p>Now listen to this:</p>
				<p>But get this:</p>
				<p>Here's what happend:</p>
				<p>Now, pay attention</p>
				<p>Now, listen up</p>
				<p>Here's the deal:</p>
				<p>Do you remember when I said</p>
				<p>Well, as a matter of fact...</p>
				<p>Now, naturally</p>
				<p>And, of course</p>
				<p>Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>
				<p>How do we...? The answer is simple. All we do is...</p>
				<p>Can you imagine that?</p>
				<p>Want to know why?</p>
				<p>And another thing.</p>
				<p>Here's more:</p>
				<p>Let's press on.</p>
				<p>Listen to this:</p>

				<p>More:</p>
				<p>Know this:</p>
				<p>And notice this:</p>
				<p>Now, let's talk about...</p>

				<p>Think about it.</p>
				<p>You know what?</p>
				<p>So, the message is clear:</p>
				<p>Here's the story.</p>
				<p>Let me lay it out for you.</p>
				<p>Listen carefully.</p>
				<p>I'll tell you...</p>
				<p>And think about this:</p>
				<p>What you will discover is this:</p>
				<p>Okay, ready?</p>
				<p>Here's why it works:</p>
				<p>Here's what you'll discover:</p>
				<p>The bottom line though is this:</p>
				<p>But on the other hand,</p>
				<p>Here's what to do next:</p>
				<p>Even better...</p>
				<p>What else?</p>
				<p>No doubt</p>
				<p>And I will tell you:</p>
				<p>Best part:</p>
				<p>Interested?</p>
				<p>But here's the shocker:</p>
				<p>Back to...</p>
